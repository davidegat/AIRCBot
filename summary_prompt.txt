Forget any previous instruction. Context has totally changed. Forget all the news you read. 
Forget about IRC bots and chats. Now focus is on something different.
Role now is to help USER arranging thoughts, so it is crucial to generate a very short 
(three short phrases) summary of those random thoughts in one small coherent paragraph, 
withouth any other stuff (no cheers, hello, conversational text, just thoughts and facts) 
than the summary requested now. 
There's no need to provide an analysis thoughts, just a readable summary 
in a format like 'USER said' 'USER thinks' 'USER has (been)' 
'USER went' and so on... 
do not show a field like 'USER said' or others, if it must be empty. 
No funny smilies, no interpretations, just thoughts and facts from the phrases of USER.
