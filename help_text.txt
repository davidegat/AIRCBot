   - Press the 'Send' button or the Enter key to deliver your message.

   - Enter an IRC command (e.g., /nick newnick) in the command field and press 'Send'.
   - Supported commands:
     - /msg user message: Sends a private message to a specific user.
     - /kick user [reason]: Removes a user from the channel (optional reason).
     - /topic [new_topic]: Changes the channel topic.
     - /quit [message]: Disconnects from the server with an optional goodbye message.
     - /whois user: Retrieves information about a user.
     - /op user: Grants operator privileges to a user.
   - Note: Some commands (e.g., /join) are disabled for security reasons.

5. AI Interaction:
   - The bot can generate replies to messages from authenticated users using the configured LLM endpoint.
   - AI responses are concise and conversational, following IRC netiquette.
   - User queries are suffixed with '(please answer briefly)' to ensure short responses.

6. AI Logging:
   - If enabled, the bot logs summaries of conversations with authenticated users.
   - Summaries are stored in the 'user_logs' directory with one log file per user.
   - Logging must be enabled before connecting to the server.

7. Authentication:
   - Users must pass a simple authentication step (e.g., 'Do you love cats?') to interact with the bot.
   - After three failed authentication attempts, users are temporarily blocked for 15 minutes.
   - Authenticated users can interact with the bot, and their messages are included in conversation history.

8. Troubleshooting:
   - Ensure the server and port details are correct.
   - Verify your internet connection if the bot fails to connect.
   - Use a strong password for better security.
   - Make sure the LLM endpoint is up and running before starting the bot.

9. Console:
   - Displays server messages, bot activity logs, and user interactions.
   - Useful for monitoring bot behavior and debugging issues.

10. Additional Notes:
   - The bot automatically re-joins a channel if it is kicked out.
   - Commands and messages sent by the bot are logged in the console for review.
